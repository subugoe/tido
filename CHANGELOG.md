## [0.0.20] - 2020-07-10

### Changed

- The page deployment now takes places without having to store any data externally.
We only rely on previous artifacts for new pipelines.

## [0.0.19] - 2020-07-03

### Added

- replace basic page / sheet counter by *original* pagelabel delivered by the api.

## [0.0.18] - 2020-07-02

### Fixed

- TreeView: expanded-stack. switched from pop() to splice(). pop() broke the stack, since it deals with the stack tail
- TreeView: root node (collection title) is expandable / collapsible now as well

## [0.0.17] - 2020-07-01

### Fixed

- TreeView: according to the Quasar maintainer, q-tree doesn't provide a possibility to have nodes selected and expanded in the same step. it behaves so by design!
  So: provided a handler function to fake this very behaviour. Manifest titles now toggle on click (expand / collapse) without being selected.
- Actual Item is now selected at Viewer start (init)
- expanded-stack grew by clicking an item (same title has been pushed onto the array/stack over and over again). this is now handled by comparing the appropriate sequence-index.

## [0.0.16] - 2020-06-25

### Added

- Configured to anchor manifest title to top of the panel.

## [0.0.15] - 2020-06-24

### Fixed

- Reverted the changes and fixed the icons to nest inside image.

## [0.0.14] - 2020-06-23

### Added

- filter function to the tree: now able to filter by labels, e.g. 122v

### Changed

- delete obsolete code sections
- fix indents for better readability
- extend the README file in regards to front-end setup
- delete quasar's `selected`-prop used for the *q-tree*-component to disable the selection of manifest titles
- rename var `pagelabel` to `Ã¬temlabel` which seems to be more descriptive

- remove artifacts from blob that are older than 2 weeks.
this generally speeds up the build process and prevents errors since GitLab can only handle artifacts up to a certain size.
- Configured to anchor manifest title to top of the panel.
