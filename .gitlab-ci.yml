# this stage checks if an entry point is set in src/index.template.html and removes it.
# the reasoning behind this is that the entry point should be empty on `develop` and `main`
# so that releases don't accidentally ship an entry point.
# during this stage, the variable $CONTINUE_BUILD is set and exported which determines if
# the following pipeline stages are fully executed. if an entry point has to be removed, it is
# set to 'false' since src/index.template.html is modified and recomitted which triggers a new
# pipeline.
